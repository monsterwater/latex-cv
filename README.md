Build environment for LaTeX files: specifically, the CV template from http://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/

To generate PDFs in Ubuntu 10.4, you'll need to install the following packages:
  texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended
along with SBT 0.7.4 from:
  http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

Use {{sbt latex}} to generate the output PDF in target/. You can also run {{sbt ~latex}} to have SBT watch the input LaTeX files and automatically rebuild when they change: combine with a PDF viewer that supports automatically refreshing a document for best results.
